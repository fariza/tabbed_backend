Matplotlib backend using a notebook in Gtk3

While the work on MEP27 https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/4143 is merged and the work
on MEP23 (Multi Figure Manager) is done this little project allows to use a Notebook to
hold several figures.

To run it needs Matplotlib Master and for the moment it is only available for GTK3
If you have any problems, questions or suggestions just let me know (issues, PRs)

Take a look at https://github.com/fariza/tabbed_backend/blob/master/example.py for a simple example
